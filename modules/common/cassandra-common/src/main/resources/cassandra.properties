# Defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to a node on the ring. The more tokens,
# relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data that this node will store. You
# probably want all nodes to have the same number of tokens assuming they have equal
# hardware capability. Tokens are randomly generated with the expectation of an even
# distribution. With that said, there can be some variation. Either increasing this value
# or increasing the number of nodes in the cluster will help even out the distribution.

# rhq-container.build.xml. This is done as a convenience for developers so that they can
