# When a node initializes it contacts a seed and then sleeps for RING_DELAY (milliseconds)
# to learn about other nodes in the cluster. This defaults to 30 seconds. Cassandra gets
# the value from the cassandra.ring_delay_ms system property
# rhq.cassandra.ring.delay

# Defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to a node on the ring. The more tokens,
# relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data that this node will store. You
# probably want all nodes to have the same number of tokens assuming they have equal
# hardware capability. Tokens are randomly generated with the expectation of an even
# distribution. With that said, there can be some variation. Either increasing this value
# or increasing the number of nodes in the cluster will help even out the distribution.

# The remaining properties pertain to cluster configuration and are only used in

# are also loaded into the container build (when the dev profile is active) in the
# rhq-container.build.xml script. If you add any properties below here that pertain to
# cluster configuration for an embedded cluster, please also update
# rhq-container.build.xml. This is done as a convenience for developers so that they can
# just update rhq-server.properties to change the cluster configuration.
