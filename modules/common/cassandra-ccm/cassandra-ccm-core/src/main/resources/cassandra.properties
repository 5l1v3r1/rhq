# Defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to a node on the ring. The more tokens,
# relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data that this node will store. You
# probably want all nodes to have the same number of tokens assuming they have equal

# distribution. With that said, there can be some variation. Either increasing this value
# or increasing the number of nodes in the cluster will help even out the distribution.
