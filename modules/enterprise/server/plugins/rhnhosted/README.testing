Overview:
  Run a test against RHN Hosted to see if basic rhnhosted functionality is working.

What will be tested:
  Package Syncs & Distribution Syncs

Setup:
  1) systemid file is required at: "/etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid"  
  Register a RHEL5 system to RHN Hosted.
  Copy the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid file from the RHEL5 box to your local machine where you will be running RHQ and this test.

  2) /usr/share/rhn/RHNS-CA-CERT
  This is required if you want to run against a https connection
  Copy this from a RHEL5 box

  3) Edit pom.xml
  Change the property:  "RunRHNProviderTest" to "true".
  
  If you want to run a more exhaustive test change:
  "RunRHNMD5SumTests" to "true".  This will download each package and kickstart file and compare the md5sum against the expected value.

Run:
    Execute:  mvn test -Dtest="RHNProviderTest"
