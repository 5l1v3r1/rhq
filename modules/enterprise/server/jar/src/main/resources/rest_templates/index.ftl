<h2>RHQ Rest API</h2>
<strong>Please note: the API is not stable at this point. Do not rely on it.</strong><br/>

Join us in making it great by providing feedback and contributions of code and examples
that use the api.
See also <a href="http://rhq-project.org/display/RHQ/Design-REST">the RHQ wiki</a> on REST.
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rhq-project/samples/tree/master/rest-api">RHQ samples project</a>
for samples in various programming languages and
<a href="https://github.com/pilhuhn/RHQpocket">RHQpocket</a> as an example of a
mobile client (Android) of the API.

<h2>Misc examples (using <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">D3.js</a>)</h2>
Those examples use the powerful D3 library and are rendering the graphs in SVG.
They expect some resources and schedules being present from an initial import with
an empty database (meaning resource ids and schedule ids starting at 10001).
