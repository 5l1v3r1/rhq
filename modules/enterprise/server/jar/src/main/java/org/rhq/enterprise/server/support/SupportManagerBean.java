/**
 * Provides some methods that are useful for supporting managed resources. This includes being
 * able to take a snapshot report of a managed resource, such as its log files, data files, and anything
 * the managed resource wants to expose.
 * 
 * This Support subsystem provides things like snapshot reports that are potentially very sensitive and
 * gives the user access to far sweeping data, (e.g. they can contain configuration settings, data files
 * and logs - all of which can contain confidential information). Because of this, most of the methods
 * in this subsystem will require the user to be an "inventory manager" with {@link Permission#MANAGE_INVENTORY}
 * permissions.
