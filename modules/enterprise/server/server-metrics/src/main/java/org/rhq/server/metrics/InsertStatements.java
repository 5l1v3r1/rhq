/**
 * <p>
 * A cache of prepared statements for inserting metric data. We want to use prepared statements to insert metric data
 * to avoid the query parsing overhead that would otherwise be incurred on each write request. In Cassandra 1.2.x,
 * neither the TTL nor the column timestamp can be specified as bind parameters in a prepared statement. In RHQ 4.12
 * we added support for storing and aggregating data from late measurement reports. The TTLs for late data could be
 * wrong which in turn could throw of aggregate metrics when they got recomputed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class ensures that data is expired consistently, regardless of whether or not it is coming in a late measurement
 * report. Column timestamps are rounded down to the start of the day on which the metric was collected. This means that
 * a metric collected at 11:00 AM will expire at the same time as one collected at 11:00 PM on the same day.
 * </p>
