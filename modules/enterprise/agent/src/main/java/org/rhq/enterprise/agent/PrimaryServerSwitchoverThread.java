/**
 * This thread's job is to periodically try to get the agent to point back to
 * its primary server, if it isn't pointing to that server already.
 * 
 * The "primary server" is the server found at the top of the agent's failover list.
 * If the agent is already talking to this server, or if the agent does not yet have
 * a failover list, nothing needs to be done.
 * 
 * If the agent is talking to another server, this thread will probe the primary server
 * and if it can, this thread will switch the agent's sender back to point to the primary.
 * 
 * If the agent is not in sending mode, this thread will not do anything until it is.  The agent
 * will decide what server it should talk to in that case.  This thread is only here
 * to prevent an agent talking to a non-primary server for a long time when the primary
 * server is available.
