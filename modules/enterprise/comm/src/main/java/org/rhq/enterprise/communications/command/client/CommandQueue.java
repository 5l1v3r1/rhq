/**
 * This is the queue that will be used by {@link ClientCommandSender} to queue up command tasks that have to be sent.
 * The queue implements {@link BlockingQueue}; if you instantiate it with a capacity of 0 or less, it will actually be
 * unbounded (i.e. theoretical capacity at {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}).
 *
 * <p>This queue supports "throttling", that is, only permits X number of commands at most to be taken from the queue in
 * Y number of milliseconds. Throttling is disabled unless specifically enabled in the configuration given this object
 * when this object is constructed or by calling {@link #enableQueueThrottling()}. Throttling affects
 * {@link #poll(long)} and {@link #take()}. Throttling does not affect how fast you can add commands to the queue - you
 * can queue commands as fast as you can.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because this is going to be a work queue for a {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}, and because of the strict type required
 * of work queues in its constructor, I must implement BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable>, but I really wanted
 * &lt;ClientCommandSenderTask> because the runnables stored in this queue should really only be of type
 * {@link ClientCommandSenderTask}.</p>
