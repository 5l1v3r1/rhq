button_reset = Reset
button_save = Save
button_startInstallation = Press To Start The Installation Now
button_testConnection = Test Connection
help_dbConnectionUrl = This is the JDBC connection URL that will be used to determine where your database server is and how to connect to it.
help_dbExistingSchemaOption = Your database already has a schema installed. This option tells the installer what you want to do with this existing schema. You can either:<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the existing schema. This will upgrade the schema to support the new server being installed but all of your resource inventory and related data will be saved.</li>\n<li>Overwrite the existing schema. This will delete all of your previous data and create a new, empty set of tables. When you do this, you will lose all of your resource inventory and related data.</li>\n<li>Skip the database schema setup. If, for some reason, you do not want the installer to do anything to your database (even to check to see if it needs to be updated), select this option. You rarely will want to use this option unless you know your database schema is completely up to date and can support the new server you are installing.</li>\n</ul>
help_dbPassword = This is the credentials that will be used to connect to the database. This is the actual password for your user, not the encrypted password. The installer will encrypt this password for you before storing it in the properties file.
help_dbType = Select the type of database that is to be used by the server. The server only supports these types of databases.
help_dbUsername = The server will connect to the database as this user.
help_registeredServers = If you are performing an upgrade or a re-installation then you should select a server from this list of registered servers. If you want to install a new server into the system, select the *New Server* option. (Note that if you are going to overwrite your existing schema, you cannot select an existing registered server since they will be deleted when the overwrite is performed.)
help_ssEmailFromAddress = When the server sends emails (e.g. via alert email notifications), this will be the address that will be in the email From: line.
help_ssEmailHostname = This is the SMTP server hostname that will be used to send emails by this server.
help_ssHttpPort = This is the HTTP port that users can use to access the web GUI for this server. This is also the same port that agents will use to talk to this server if the agents send messages over the servlet protocol (which is the default protocol).
help_ssHttpsPort = This is the secure HTTPS port that users can use to access the web GUI for this server. This is also the same port that agents will use to talk to this server if the agents send messages over the sslservlet protocol.
help_ssPublicAddress = This is the IP address or hostname that agents will use to connect to this server. This value is not stored in server properties file; rather, it is stored in the database. You can later modify this value in the Administration (Topology) > Servers section of the GUI.
help_ssServerName = This is a unique name to be assigned to this server. All servers must be assigned unique server names, however, they do not have to match the IP address or hostname of the server.
help_testConnectionButton = You must confirm that your database settings are correct by pushing this button which tests the connection settings.
message_formDidNotValidate = Please fix the errors before continuing.
message_install_done = The installation has completed.
message_install_failed = The installation failed.
