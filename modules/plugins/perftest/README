Usage
=============================

- Deploy the perftest plugin to the RHQ Server (by default, the Agent will download the plugin on startup)
- The scenario to use is specified to the agent through a system property. The value of this property should be the
  name of the XML file without the .xml extension. The property name is rhq.perftest.scenario. For example (remove
  the quotes):

    "-Drhq.perftest.scenario=high-servers-1000"

- Some scenarios may be configurable and require other system properties to dictate their behavior. Check the
  scenario XML files for more details.

Two properties allow to control the time it takes for discovery and getValues(). This allows to better mimic real
life, where a target server never returns data in 0ms.

- rhq.perftest.getvaluesdelayms  -- delay for getValues() in ms
- rhq.perftest.discoverydelayms  -- delay for discovery of one individual resource

If the values are 0 or not given, no delay happens.
