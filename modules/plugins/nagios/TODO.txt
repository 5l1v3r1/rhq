Important things that will have to be done in the future:

-Enlarge the plugin to make it possible to get all the metrics of Nagios
  -At the moment it is limited to only a few metrics because there is a bug in the parser that has to be fixed first
-Update wiki documentation to include the latest changes
-More logging output for debug purpose in all the classes
-Add hosts to the type hierachy (at the moment hard coded "localhost")
  - have on discovery the host of a service put into a property within the connection properties
    of the service, so that it is possible to create groups that contain all services of a host

- get logfiles via mk_livestatus and feed them into the events subsystem
-Check if ChildResourceTypes allready have been detected and if so, do not snychronize agent and server to avoid useless capture of system resources
- Create new Discovery and Component classes to handle new ChildResourceTypes
-Let the plugin work with the MK_Livestatus information and disable hard-coded creation of new ResourceTypes
