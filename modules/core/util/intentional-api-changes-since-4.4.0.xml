            This is a protected method and thus accessible only to subclasses. No known subclasses exist.
            This is a source-compatible change though (this method used to be void so no caller could have
            used the return type) so if there exists a subclass in the 3rd party code, it is going to
            be enough for that code to be recompiled to start working again.
