/**
 * This annotation denotes that a remote method will be limited in the amount of concurrent calls it can handle on the
 * server. This annotation takes a string parameter which identifies the name of the "concurrency queue" that limits the
 * number of threads that can execute the method concurrently. The actual number of threads that are allowed to
 * concurrently invoke the method is configured separately on the server side. This annotation does not affect the
 * client side at all - only the server-side invocation of the remote pojo method will be affected.
 *
 * <p>This annotation must be used within an <b>interface</b>, as opposed to a class definition, in order for it to take
 * effect. In other words, when you write your remote POJO, this annotation must be used in the remote POJO's interface
 * - not its implementation class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Unlike other comm annotations, there is no Command configuration property that is analogous to this annotation. In
 * other words, you can only limit the concurrency of remote POJO invocations; you cannot limit the concurrency of raw
 * Commands sent to the server. This makes sense because we want to enforce the rules on the server-side and not rely on
 * clients to turn on concurrency controls (if we did, that would allow rogue clients to be able to circumvent the
 * concurrency controls).</p>
