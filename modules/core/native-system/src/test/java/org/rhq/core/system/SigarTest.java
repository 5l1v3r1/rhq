/**
 * The purpose of this class is to provide a simple main class that can be run from the command line so we can send it
 * to the SIGAR project team members when we need to report a bug and they need a simple replication test case. All
 * tests that we replicate with this class needs to also have a corresponding unit test. When the bug is fixed, we can
 * clean out this class's main() for the next replication procedure - we won't lose the test because it will have been
 * duplicated somewhere in our unit test suite.
