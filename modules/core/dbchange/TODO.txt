* Find out into what type liquibase converts BIGINT on oracle

* Make sure that any column values inserted that are character types preserve case sensitivity

* Liquibase requires foreign key names to be defined when created with <constraints> tag.
Need to find out if this will cause any problems particularly for upgrade since the sql we
generate, at least for postgresql does not explicitly declare foreign key names.
