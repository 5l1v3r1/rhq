### Building the Codebase###

Here is the happy path for building the RHQ, it assumes Maven, JDK7 and Postgres to be installed. There should be also precreated `rhq` database and `rhqadmin` user in Postgres DB.

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
git clone https://github.com/rhq-project/rhq.git
cp rhq/etc/m2/settings.xml ~/.m2/
cd rhq
mvn clean -Ddbsetup -Penterprise,dev -DskipTests install
{% endhighlight %}
