       <p>You should have arrived at this page by clicking on a Resource
          tab defined by the sample perspective.
          As evidenced by the URL in your browser's address bar, this
          page was loaded from the core RHQ GUI. However, the
          pink portion of this page is an IFRAME whose content was
          loaded from rhq-sample-perspective.war, a WAR deployed to the
          RHQ Server, as a sibling of rhq.ear.</p>
