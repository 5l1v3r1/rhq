# What UNIX user the JBoss AS java process will run as.
# (The shutdown client is always run as the invoker of the
# init script). JBoss AS will be run as root by default, but, for
# the sake of security, it is recommended that you chown the JBoss
# AS installation files to a non-root user and use that use here.
# Note, you do need to run as root if your server will listen on one
# or more privileged (< 1024) ports. If you really do want to run as
# root, comment out the JBOSS_USER variable completely (i.e. do not
# set it to root). This will run the server process without "su".
#JBOSS_USER=jboss

#
# Specify the maximum file descriptor limit, use "max" or "maximum" to use
# the default, as queried by the system.
#
# Defaults to "maximum"
#
#MAX_FD="maximum"

#
# Default is to not load profiler configuration file.

# Specify the location of the Java Rntime Environment (JRE) or 
# Java Development Kit (JDK) installation directory. If not set,
# "/usr/java/default" will be used.
#
#JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/default"

#
# Specify options to pass to the Java VM (if unset, a default
# set of options will be used).
#
# Note, if you want to pass the default options but some of 
# your own additional options in, then set the 
# ADDITIONAL_JAVA_OPTS variable (see below), rather than JAVA_OPTS.

# Specify additional options to pass to the Java VM. These are passed
# in addition to the default set of options,
# i.e. java $JAVA_OPTS $ADDITIONAL_JAVA_OPTS ... org.jboss.Main ...
