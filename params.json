As such it allows to gather metrics from so called managed resources, alert on values of the metrics or state change and other conditions. RHQ is also able to provision new content onto managed resources, run operations on them etc.\r\n\r\nThe list of supported managed resources is not hard coded, but provided by (agent) [plugins](https://github.com/rhq-project/rhq/tree/master/modules/plugins).\r\n\r\n## Wiki and issue tracker\r\nThe [RHQ wiki](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/Home) contains information about running RHQ as well as a lot of design documentation.\r\n\r\nIssues for RHQ are currently tracked in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/browse.cgi?product=RHQ%20Project)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIf you wish to get involved as a contributor to RHQ, please visit `#rhq` channel on Freenode IRC and get to know people.
